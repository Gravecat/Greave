# Greave Repository Branches

If you are interested in contributing to the Greave project, please take note of the repository's branches:

`main`: The main development branch, everything here is more or less set in stone. The main branch will only ever be rebased and/or force-pushed in extreme circumstances.

`contrib`: Any and all pull requests should target the contrib branch. Once the pull request has been accepted and tested, a repo admin will merge it into main.

`indev`: Work in progress from [the primary developer](https://github.com/Gravecat). This branch is likely to be rebased, force-pushed, reverted, and generally be in all sorts of flux at any given time. Feel free to peek if you're curious, but expect this branch to be highly unstable. Please do not submit any pull requests based on this branch's code, unless you have been explicitly asked to.

**Any other branches** are temporary feature branches or un-rebased work, and should be ignored entirely unless it's something you're personally working on. Expect any and all other branches to be rebased or deleted without warning.
