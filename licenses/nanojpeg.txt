This is a cosmetic restructing and port to C++ class of 'NanoJPEG', found
at http://keyj.s2000.ws/?p=137. It's been made somewhat thread safe in that
all context information is pulled into an object, rather than being global
as the original was. Other than that, the original is superior in
configurability, comments, cleanliness, portability, etc. and should be
preferred. The only other possible benefit this version can claim is that
it's crammed into one header file.
