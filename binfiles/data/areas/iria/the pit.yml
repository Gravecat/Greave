THE_PIT:
  desc: What was once likely a fairly large warehouse is now mostly rubble, though a patchwork repair job is keeping the roof up for the moment. {lb} ```Aside from a few old crates and half-broken furniture strewn around, there isn't a great deal to see here; one heavy metal door leads south to the street outside, while the other to the north is more battered and rusted, flaking red paint scrawled across it declaring that this is the entrance to "The Pit".
