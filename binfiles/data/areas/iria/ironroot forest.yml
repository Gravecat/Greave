CRYSTAL_LAKE_CN:
  desc: Here in the middle of the lake, the tranquil water makes your surroundings seem so peaceful. The lake is deeper here, though you can still see through the clear water to the silty mud beneath. The lake extends around you in all directions, flanked around its rim by tall, ancient trees.

CRYSTAL_LAKE_S:
  desc: The southern side of the lake is tranquil and beautiful, the water so crystal-clear you can see all the way down to the silty mud at the base. Heavy, ancient trees flank the edge of the lake, unruly and wild to the west, while eastward a grassy trail runs between the thick trunks and the water's edge.

CRYSTAL_LAKE_SE:
  desc: The southeast corner of this wide, crystal-clear lake is bordered by a well-traveled, grassy forest trail, flanked further behind by tall, gnarled, ancient trees. The water is still and peaceful, cold and clear as glass. Below, you can see the movement of small fish causing the silty dirt at the bottom of the lake to billow and churn.

IRONROOT_1:
  desc: The forest here curves around the edge of a beautiful, crystal-clear lake to the south, though the further to the west you proceed, the more wild and unruly the undergrowth becomes. There's enough landmarks to find your way around - a moss-covered log here, a patch of vivid purple flowers there - though it gets harder to discern deeper in.

IRONROOT_2:
  desc: It's hard to keep your bearings in the forest, each overgrown grassy path between thick tree-trunks seeming the same as the last. The presence of a lake to the east is somewhat of a saving grace, the glittering clear water providing a clear landmark amidst the greens and browns of the forest.

  wilderness: forest

IRONROOT_3:
  desc: The trees grow wilder and thicker the deeper you venture into the dense forest, the trail to the southeast almost out of sight already amidst the unruly undergrowth. It may be possible to push your way through the long grasses to the east or to return to the trail, but all other directions are too heavily forested to navigate.

  wilderness: forest

IRONROOT_4:
  desc: Ancient, gnarled trees surround you, their branches reaching high above to form a thick canopy obscuring the sky, their twisted roots threatening to trip and snag unwary travelers. The undergrowth is wild and abundant, and it's hard to make much headway deeper into the woods - you might be able to push through the foliage to the south or west, but other directions are a no go.

  wilderness: forest

IRONROOT_5:
  desc: This path between the ancient trees is a dead end, the thick trunks and gnarled roots closing in around you the further west you move. The foliage and long grasses are too wild and verdant here; the only way you can go from here is back eastward.

IRONROOT_6:
  desc: The forest is thick and wild at the edge of clearing here, unruly paths of wild grass running deeper to the west and southwest. A clearer path is visible to the northeast, while the trees thin and open to a wide, grassy clearing spotted with colourful flowers to the east and south.

IRONROOT_7:
  desc: The wild, fractious trees thin a little towards the west here, opening into a wide, grassy clearing where the tangled canopy of branches does not reach. Further south and west the woods grow denser and more brooding, while the undergrowth and thick, gnarled trunks grow too dense to proceed further north.

IRONROOT_8:
  desc: The eastern side of the forest is thick and untamed, the venerable trees seeming to continue forever in each direction, the route cluttered with dense undergrowth. It's impossible to make much headway anywhere other than a north/south direction between these hoary trunks, and even then the going is relentlessly slow.

  wilderness: forest

IRONROOT_9:
  desc: The western side of the forest is entirely too dense and overgrown to proceed any deeper, the gnarled trees thick and impassive, a carpet of soft green moss growing on their cracked trunks. The only way to proceed is in an eastern direction, where the trees start to thin and open up into a wide, grassy clearing, flecked with colourful wildflowers.

IRONROOT_10:
  desc: The forest around you is thick and gloomy, the aged trees growing wide and tall, the trail clogged by long grasses and thorny vines. The trees open up into a grassy clearing to the west, through which you can see a run-down well, while the woods deepen to the east.

IRONROOT_11:
  desc: Here at the west side of the wide, crystal-clear lake, the trees are densely-packed and unruly, their greedy roots stretching across the grassy dirt close to the water's edge. Rough paths between the tall, wild grass wind deeper into the forest's gloom.

IRONROOT_12:
  desc: The woods grow thicker and denser the further you travel to the east, the talon-like branches closing in above and obscuring the sky. The thick undergrowth and thorny vines make it difficult to venture deeper, though the forest thins somewhat in the western direction. A huge fallen tree-trunk entirely blocks passage to the north, covered in a coat of soft green moss.

IRONROOT_13:
  desc: It's difficult to keep your bearings this deep into the woods, the ancient trees all looking alike, their branches forming a thick canopy above you to obscure the sky. The grass beneath your feet is wild and long, tiny wildflowers and toadstools sprouting between the foliage. Your path is almost entirely blocked to the east, the forest becoming too unruly and crowded with thorns and thick trees.

IRONROOT_14:
  desc: Here at the south side of the clearing, the broad, crooked trees grow dense, the undergrowth thorny and impenetrable. The woods extend further to the south, but you're unable to delve deeper from here. The trees thin out and form a wide clearing north of here, colourful wildflowers speckled among the long grass.

IRONROOT_15:
  desc: The massive, ancient trees seem to crowd in on you at the south side of the clearing, their crooked branches reaching high above like talons. The undergrowth is thick and impassive, thorny bushes and densely-packed woods impeding your progress deeper. The trees grow sparse to the north, opening into a grassy clearing, and you can see some sort of old stone well in the midst of the long grass.

IRONROOT_16:
  desc: Dense trees curve around the crystal-clear lake to the northeast, their twisted roots forming a thirsty border. Thorny bushes and thick, tangled grasses join with the wide tree-trunks to effectively block passage to the southwest, though the woods open somewhat as the lake's border curves north.

IRONROOT_17:
  desc: The grassy, well-worn trail to the east becomes more unruly and wild here, the grasses long and untamed, crooked roots threatening to trip unwary travelers. There's no clear way to push into the woods to the south, the only space offering passage flanking around the wide, crystal-clear lake to the north.

IRONROOT_CLEARING_N:
  desc: You stand at the northern end of a wide clearing in the forest, stretching out further to the south and southwest. The gnarled old trees ring the outside, their twisted branches reaching inward, yet no trees grow on the soft, wild grass that blankets the area. Tiny, colourful wildflowers are scattered across the clearing, hiding amidst the grass.

IRONROOT_CLEARING_S:
  desc: The southern side of this wide clearing stretches out to the north and west, the soft grass dappled with wildflowers and tiny mushrooms. The forest surrounds you in all other directions, hoary trees reaching their crooked branches into the sky high above. An old stone well stands nearby, the wood rotten and the stones mossy, a grimy old rope dangling down into the gloom below.

IRONROOT_TRAIL_3:
  desc: "The forest trail curves here as the mighty, ancient trees block passage in all but two directions: the trees seem to thin somewhat to the west, while the woods deepen to the southeast."

IRONROOT_TRAIL_4:
  desc: The grassy trail through this densely-wooded forest extends in a roughly northwest/southeast direction, the wild grass trampled from frequent passage. Tall, ancient trees block passage deeper into the forest, save for passage between the trees leading into wild, untamed grass to the south.

IRONROOT_TRAIL_5:
  desc: The trees seem to crowd in oppressively around you along this well-worn, grassy trail. The path continues northwest/southeast, though there's enough space through the undergrowth to venture deeper into the forest to the west. A wide lake opens up to the south, the clear water glittering beautifully.

IRONROOT_TRAIL_6:
  desc: It's easy to lose your sense of direction this deep into the woods. The trail you're on curves around a crystal-clear lake, the path heading northwest and south, while an opening to wilder grass and deeper woods branches off northeast of here.

IRONROOT_TRAIL_7:
  desc: Tall, ancient gnarled trees surround you, twisted branches reaching high into the sky above. The woods thin as the ground gives way to a sparkling, clear lake to the west, and a well-worn trail through the grass leads north/south. Eastward, the forest deepens and darkens.

IRONROOT_TRAIL_8:
  desc: The trail branches here, curving around the crystal-clear lake as the grassy path leads north and southwest, while a well-traveled branch beckons through the tall trees to the east. The trunk of a long-since fallen tree sits south of the trail, covered in soft patches of emerald-green moss as the forest slowly reclaims it.

IRONROOT_TRAIL_9:
  desc: The trees have grown wild and unruly here, the grassy trail between the thick, heavy roots twisting and turning, curving around a particularly large and imposing tree as the path leads northeast and southeast. It's possible to find passage through the trees to the west, though the foliage there seems more unruly and seldom-traveled, while north of here lies a wide lake of glittering, crystal-clear water.

IRONROOT_TRAIL_10:
  desc: Trees press in around you at all sides, ancient gnarled trunks and thick roots digging deep into the soil. The grassy trail, well-traveled yet overgrown, curves west and southeast through the woods, while there's enough space between the trees to venture deeper into the forest wilds to the northeast.

IRONROOT_WELL:
  desc: Lit only from the open well-shaft above you, the base of this well is a grimy and dismal place. The little water that remains is filthy and stagnant, a grimy pool that reaches up to your mid-thigh, while the cobblestone walls of the well are slick with moss and dirt. {lb} ```Curiously, a number of stones have been dislodged, a muddy tunnel leading into darkness to the east. If that doesn't suit you, the only other way out is a filthy old rope dangling from the opening above.
