ARROW_PARK:
  desc: The atmosphere is thick and heavy, tall exhaust and flare stacks of nearby refineries looming ominously in the polluted sky. Here, surrounded by the city walls and the debris of dreams, rests a small natural sanctuary. The grass is thick and green underfoot, carpeting this half-block of city property. Tall trees block out a little of the surrounding buildings, leaves rustling softly. Covering almost a quarter of the park is a large pool, edged in natural rock and varying in depth. {lb} ```To the south stand thick pines, hidden behind which is a heavy stone platform - the twin skyguard ballistae rising toward the treetops in dark testament. Gates in the park walls lie north, east and west.

BERESTALL_CHURCH:
  desc: The northeast corner of the intersection once held a building, but only foundations remain. Erected over the gaping hole is a faded and weathered billboard, reading simply 'He sees...' in black on white. Two other corners hold more mundane buildings, reaching two and three storeys towards the clouds high above, while the eastern building appears to be a general store of sorts, its windows obscured by cobwebs inside. {lb} ```Church Avenue runs north and south, steeples of another holy monument rising into the skyline to the south.

BERESTALL_END:
  desc: There is the park to the east, a street, a solid wall of buildings, then as one heads westward... nothing. The city, the civilian eye will notice, has been flattened from that wall of buildings to the sea four miles distant. Rising up to the west are the foundations of a post-apocalyptic dystopia. {lb} ```The road ends here, abruptly, the paving stones underfoot melted and torn to shreds. Buildings still rise, up to twelve feet at best, above the broken sidewalks and piles of brick and shingle that litter the ground. The wide dirt track that was once a street continues on to the west.

BERESTALL_KINGS:
  desc: Two roads collide without a sound, a battered street marker reading 'Berestall Street' and 'King's Road'. The sky is obscured by a tall building to the southeast, looming ominously over this intersection. More residential buildings make up these city walls, with a single corner shop nestled between dilapidated structures, the sign outside proclaiming it to be 'The Hunter's Mark'. {lb} ```At the northeast corner stands another tall building, a worn and creaking sign indicating it to be 'The Red Dragon Inn'.

BERESTALL_STREET:
  desc: "Tall buildings reflect the light along the northern edge of this street. These are primarily residential buildings, though a few shops do exist; some of them are even still in business. Directly across from the entrance to the park two buildings in particular stand out: signs mark them as 'Yetu's Supplies' and 'The Golden Cauldron'. {lb} ```Through a gap in a low wall to the south lies the main central park, trees rising toward the sky, yet still dwarfed by the surrounding buildings, while the street stretches east and west."

BERESTALL_STREET_2:
  desc: The shadows of the park's trees lay across the pavement, drawing stripes down a north-south road, apparently labeled 'Crosswood Alley' by a rusted street corner sign. It intersects here with Berestall. The surrounding buildings seem less imposing, as a quarter of the nearest area is the central park and the southwest quadrant is taken up by the Central Underground station. {lb} ```A wide set of stairs leads down into the subway, a weatherbeaten and faded sign proclaiming the name stretched over the stairs.

BLACK_MARKET_WAREHOUSE:
  desc: "The ceiling rises high overhead, massive horizontal beams and corroding ductwork laid visible. The large high windows have been boarded over just letting narrow beams of light spill across the stone floor. Lighting, however, is not sparse: wall-mounted aether-lanterns bathe the open room in pale ambiance. {lb} ```Tables ring the walls, each staffed by a strange, short and fuzzy creature whose white fur glows with radiance under the aether-light, each dressed in a loose shirt or long coat, selling their assorted wares of adventuring supplies, promising prime weaponry upon show of coin. {lb} ```Boxes and crates lie littered about the walls, cleared away from a door, emblazoned with the symbol of an old pre-war currency, leading into a back room. Finally, nearly hidden behind a line of tall cabinets, a heavy metal door leads out to the east."

BRASS_DIRK:
  desc: Dim light shining in through grubby, cracked windows glitters through the thick smoke hanging heavy in the air. What was once a warehouse is now a disreputable-looking tavern, a set of creaking wooden stairs curving up from the entrance to an old wooden floor bearing sinister stains and a strong scent of stale ale. Simple wooden stools sit around a number of round tables, while a stained bar is poorly-lit by flickering aether-lanterhs. {lb} ```Another flight of stairs leads northward, up from the tavern area, past which you can see a large metal cage.

BRASS_DIRK_ARENA:
  desc: The upper floor of this converted warehouse composes what can be called an 'arena' in the loosest sense of the word. The stained, hardwood floorboards creak and groan in protest as you stand here, a wide area to allow crowds to gather around the main event, a large and heavy steel cage dominating the middle of the floor. {lb} ```A counter is set up at the side of the floor, numerous tattered papers hanging from the side advertising upcoming fights and betting odds, while the only other way out is the rickety stairway leading back down, south to the tavern. {lb} ```{c}If you wish, you can {C}PARTICIPATE {c}in a fight.

BROKEN_ALLEY:

BRULD_LEATHERWORKER:
  desc: The strong scent of fresh leather hangs heavy in the air as you enter the leatherworker's store, the brick-walled, wooden-floored building occupied largely by the merchandise on offer. Racks of armour stand on display along with boots, gloves, bags and waterskins. {lb} ```A heavy L-shaped wooden counter frames the room, behind which numerous strange tools and unfinished products line the walls, along with doors leading inward to the north and west. The door back out to the street lies south.

BRULD_LEATHERWORKER_HOUSE:
  desc: The private quarters of Bruld & Sons is a simple yet comfortable affair, a few faded yet colourful tapestries hanging on the bare brick walls, small windows letting in light from the street outside. Three beds lie beyond a hanging curtain dividing the room, and a number of shelves and cupboards hold simple personal belongings. The only exit lies east, a wooden door back to the storefront.

CALEDONIA_ALCHEMIST:
  desc: "Strange, acrid scents assault your nostrils as you enter the Golden Cauldron, a low-roofed room with heavy brick walls and a creaky, uneven wooden floor. A heavy wooden counter divides the room, beyond which two wooden doors lead inward, while the only other exit leads back south to the street outside. {lb} ```All manner of odd things line the shelves and stick out of partly-unpacked boxes behind the counter: a plethora of glass bottles containing a number of differently-coloured bubbling fluids, small piles of oddly-coloured salts, scales and claws from beasts unknown, and more."

CALEDONIA_ALCHEMIST_HOUSE:
  desc: The private rooms of the alchemist's shop are even more chaotic and disorganized than the storefront -- tables cluttered with potion bottles, books and bags of dried herbs, shelves heavy with assorted trinkets and knick-knacks. Colourful tapestries hang from the walls which are not already covered by shelves and cupboards, and a large bed is half-covered by dusty old books and empty bottles. The only exit is southwest, back to the storefront.

CALEDONIA_ALCHEMIST_STOREROOM:
  desc: If it was possible for the back room to be any more cluttered and disorganized than the main room of the store, it is. Half-opened crates hold contain strange, scaly beast parts padded with hay, shelves are stocked with a number of unlabelled bottles, jars with creepy-looking things floating in thick fluids, and tools you can't even begin to recognize.

[daydawn:Daylight][nightdusk:Dim light] filters in through the window by the east door, and the rest of the dimly-lit shop is illuminated by a couple of hanging lanterns and some flickering candles. {lb} ```A large wooden counter spans the middle of the room, upon which rest a few books, a mortar and pestle, and some empty bottles. Behind the counter, shelves of potion bottles and jars of powders and salts are arranged in some semblance of order, and smaller doors occupy the north and south walls."

A round wooden table sits before a cozy, crackling fireplace set against the west wall, and a number of shelves house simple personal belongings. A large rug has been spread out beneath a comfortable looking bed, the dark red-brown fabric worn and aged. A heavy wooden door leads back out, south to the storefront."

  desc: The storeroom of the apothecary's shop is an almost incomprehensible mess -- shelves, boxes and barrels stocked with little order or reason, some full of what looks like dried, dead leaves, some filled with salts or other incomprehensible powders, a number of unlabeled bottles with fluids of varying colours. {lb} ```It's a cramped, poorly-organized, dimly-lit room with bizarre scents hanging in the air, and the only exit back through the door to the north.

  desc: The floorboards creak as you make your way into this smallish storefront, disturbed motes of dust glittering in the light. It's not a large room, but what space there is has been put to good use -- bows of various types hang on the back wall, a few on closer display on a simple wooden table, while numerous quivers and barrels hold a plethora of arrows and crossbow bolts. {lb} ```The main door back out to the street lies northwest, while smaller doors lead east and southeast.

CALEDONIA_STEEL_FISTS:
  desc: The guildhall's foyer is an unimpressive affair. Light filters in through a cracked window facing the corner of Miller's and King's, possibly held together only by the golden letting on the glass. The decrepit floorboards creak in irate protest under your feet, and a few old aether-lanterns keep the place reasonably-lit. {lb} ```A heavy wooden counter divides the room, holding a few dusty old books and yellowing pieces of parchment, behind which bookshelves flank an eastern door. A large noticeboard occupies the public-facing, north side of the wall, upon which are pinned various papers.

A set of stairs, running the width of the church, climbs to a set of tall, wooden structures encased in dark stonework and bordered in black iron. {lb} ```The building rises three storeys plus a central bell tower that rises to four, the pointed peak of the tower standing well above the surrounding mundane structures. The holy cross rises prominently from the tower, silhouetted against the sky and casting its shadow against the walls and windows of the apothecary's shop directly across the road.

The paving stones are cracked and worn, abandoned steam pipes lie partially uncovered and deep fissures cross the alley. {lb} ```There's a big metal sign leaning lengthwise against one building just beside a heavy door, though whatever was on it before has been obscured by a graffiti image of a minotaur.

No roads or trails remain, but it may be possible to slowly work one's way through the debris toward the center of the basin, where a large pond has formed. {lb} ```Beyond the circle of utter devastation and a slim line of partially standing warehouses, perhaps three miles away, is the shimmering and sparkling shape of the ocean. {lb} ```Streets run east, toward the more intact regions of the damaged city, and south, to the more populated zones. North and west, the dirt roads break up completely, leaving it a rough track in either direction.

LEWIN_LOBBY:
  desc: To say this apartment building has seen better days would be the understatement of the century. Short corridors lead to heavy doors hanging mostly intact to the south and west, leading to the streets outside, while a metal maintenance door is perpetually closed, slowly rusting and accumulating layer upon layer of fading graffiti. {lb} ```The chipped and stained stone walls are otherwise bare, a stairwell leading upward into gloom, framed by rickety, rusting metal handrails. Several apartment doors ring the lobby area, the wood cracked and paint peeling.

MILLERS_CHURCH:
  desc: Church Avenue leads northwards from here. It terminates against a gnarled chainlink fence guarding the south side, a wasteland of rubble tumbling down into a deep pit from a structural collapse long ago, with some old buildings a few blocks behind, a tall watchtower standing proud. {lb} ```Through a wooden gate to the east, a blacksmith's forge and a modest dwelling are visible. At the northwest corner of the street, a small brick building appears to house a tailor's business.

MILLERS_CROSSWOOD:
  desc: Miller's Way, with its scarred paving stones, runs east to west at the junction. Little is of note, simply buildings lining the roads, small businesses and boarded up shops, with the park and tall pines behind a short wall nearby. Crosswood Alley, narrow and winding, disappears north between two buildings. A narrower gap winds between old warehouses to the south.

MILLERS_EDGE:
  desc: The pavement slopes down abruptly, as it seems to melt... Indeed, everything west of this line seems to have been dismantled, the buildings broken down close to their foundations, distant rooftops reaching jaggedly for the pollution-choked skies. Just a few buildings close to this point still rise more than a couple of storeys.

MILLERS_KINGS:
  desc: According to the street sign, this is the crossroads of King's Road and Miller's Way. The cracked stone paving of Miller's runs east towards a tall row of buildings, and winds west through the city. Rising northwest are the tall pine trees of the park, and at the northeast corner is the city's Steel Fists guildhouse.

MILLERS_WAY:
  desc: A tall building rises a full six-plus storeys high, dominating the skyline to the southern side of the street. A few of the large warehouse windows are cracked, the gray exterior looking to have fallen on harder times. Riveted to one of the large entrance doors is a rusted sign proclaiming the building to be condemned. {lb} ```To the opposite side of the street rise the tall pines of the park, cast in light and shadow in the smoggy air.

MILLERS_WAY_2:
  desc: The long road continues stretching out far to the east and west, a rusting green street sign helpfully reading, 'Miller's Way'. Tall buildings crowd the sides of the road, cracked and dirty windows betraying a muted glow within, though the doors all seem to be chained and locked shut. A rusted sewer grate is mounted in the ground nearby, gloom beckoning beneath.

MILLERS_WAY_3:
  desc: The edge of the heavy industry zone, Miller's Way bears tall residential buildings to the north and taller warehouses and factories to the south, a few dormant exhaust stacks bursting above the skyline. The low thrum of aether-engines is barely noticeable, more of a consistent background haze. Directly south lies an alley cluttered with debris, lined with tall brick walls and broken factory glass.

MK_CASINO:
  desc: Thick, heavy smoke chokes the air in this back room, the air taking on an almost mystical haze from barely-seen aether-lanterns, buzzing in their death-throes. A dusty old pink and green sign on the wall proclaims this to be "MK's Casino", including a picture of a smiling goblin. {lb} ```Most of the strange machines here are in varying states of disrepair, though a number of slot machines, cheerfully labeled "Soopa Froot", seem in decent condition. A heavy door leads north, while the 'casino' continues east.

MK_CASINO_2:

There's a number of half-functional mechanical games machines around here, most prominent of which are a series of five-card draw video-poker cabinets.

NORTHWATCH:
  desc: You find yourself in a wide, tall room, the wooden floor beneath well-worn from the passage of many feet. A number of aether-lanterns hang from chains below the heavy wooden rafters, illuminating the area and casting deep shadows on the flat roof above. A large table occupies the middle of the room, largely covered by a map and various tiny coloured flags and other markers, while decorative suits of armour flank dusty bookshelves around the room's edge. {lb} ```Doors lead west, northwest and south - the latter especially large and heavy - while an open corridor winds eastward. A spiral staircase in the corner of the room leads both up and down.

NORTHWATCH_ARMOURY:

NORTHWATCH_CHECKPOINT:
  desc: A huge stone archway over the wide road marks the border between the east and west sides of the city. The south side is blocked entirely by a wide, tall brick back wall of a factory building, faded and torn propaganda posters flapping futilely in the breeze, while the north side is occupied by a large and entirely unattractive structure bearing the insignia of the Caledonia Guard above its wide entrance doors.

ORM_SMITHY:
  desc: The inside of Orm's Smithy is a fairly simple, wood-floored room, one door leading back outside to the west. A heavy wooden counter blocks access to the two other doors, across which are displayed a number of weapons, tools, shields, and pieces of armour, the shiny metal gleaming in the light of hanging lanterns. A number of weapon and armour racks around the walls of the room display various other wares on offer.

A table near the fire is flanked by a couple of simple chairs, and some shelves of unremarkable personal items occupy the corner, next to which lie two sturdy-looking wooden beds with colourful green blankets. {lb} ```The street outside is visible through a window in the southwest corner, and the only other exit is a heavy wooden door to the south.

  desc: Light shines through great stained glass windows, creating large patterns on the stone altar. A stone pulpit rises before the windows, large, standing proudly before the grand hall and rows of pews, benches filling the room in three columns, stretching back into the darkness. {lb} ```A mystic sense fills the air, a reverent feeling permeating the atmosphere, sermons and services given long ago hanging still all about. The window itself is huge, rising to the arched ceiling a dozen meters above, the Holy Cross displayed proudly in white glass against an orange sunburst.

The shadows close tighter farther toward the ceiling, vaulted arches cloaked in black and the dimmest gray. The inobvious pattern of floor tile coats the floor along the nave and both aisles to either side, the pathways separated by the lines of columns. It runs west to the entrance, and east, where the reddish golden hue of stained glass can be seen.

Columns hold buttressed ceilings, the arches high overhead creating a vast sound chamber that sends echoes into the dark distance. The walls, running parallel towards the east, are a fair ten meters apart and decorated in line art images, holy men and women of varied species it would seem. The hall runs toward a darkened end, just out of sight but lined with points of candlelight.

RED_DRAGON:
  desc: The entryway to the Red Dragon Inn is a fairly modest affair, a fairly small room with a simple wooden floor and plain brick walls.

RED_DRAGON_FLOOR_3:
  desc: The stairs exit on a long hallway, floorboards underfoot warped and creaking. It ends in a single window, of the same height and width of the hallway, which looks south over the lower levels of the city and allows a view from a few storeys above the surroundings. There are a few doors on each side of the hallway, most battered and worn, one covered in scratched graffiti.

RED_DRAGON_LOBBY_ROOF:
  desc: The roof tiles feel unsteady beneath your feet as you perch upon the slightly sloped roof that sits above the lobby area of the Red Dragon. The rest of the building stretches higher behind you, a single window beckoning passage back inside, while the rest of the city surrounds you to the west and south, the sound of travelers along Berestall and King's somewhat muffled by your height.

Far south are the shimmering dark waters of the bay, surrounded by its docks and piers, spanned by a single bridge. The park is a straight shot to the southwest.

  desc: Wide and fairly well lit, this set of stairs runs from the building's roof to basement, linking each of the floors and the tavern on the basement level. Well-worn wooden railings are set into some of the walls, lying functionless on the floor in other places, exit doors in similar states of disrepair. The lights are dimmer the farther down one goes.

The worn cobblestone floor is mostly clean aside from a few dark stains, and benches sit alongside three heavy wooden tables, while a few wooden stools flank the bar. A fire crackles merrily in the hearth, above which is mounted a shield bearing the insignia of a red dragon. A rickety staircase leads to the lobby and private rooms upstairs, and an old wooden door sits behind the bar.

RENASCENCE_STATION:
  desc: You stand within a great rail station, the platforms running a city block from end to end. Its glory days must have passed, for it stands largely dormant, passenger trains arriving quite sporadically; the cargo platforms see more business, the sounds of workers echoing off the dark stone walls. {lb} ```The tracks lie to the west of the stone floored platform, its edges girded in iron. A roof slopes overhead, over the benches, ticket counters, offices and information boards. A large set of doors leads you east, to the street outside.

SKYGUARD_PLATFORM:
  desc: As if it was dropped from above, the stone platform's settled firmly within the city block-wide cluster of evergreens. The huge twin ballistae of wrought iron and sturdy dark wood reach for the sky above the tree cover - dense and deep enough the city seems it might be miles away, forgiving the encroaching plumes of smoke breaching the treetops. {lb} ```The platform sits about a foot off the grass below, supporting the heavy ballistae, which currently point south - the direction of the harbour. Stairs head down to a trail northwards, while a wide, rusted iron ring marks a passage into the ground.

It seems easy enough to slip into the subway, though if it leads any distance is anyone's guess. {lb} ```The row of buildings to the east are silhouetted against the unclean sky.

YETUS_SUPPLIES:
  desc: You find yourself in the front room of a general store, the floor littered with crates and heavy boxes, the walls covered in racks bearing numerous weapons, tools, and other assorted supplies. Much of the stock on offer is of little interest to you, but a few items catch your attention. The heavy, warped floorboards creak as you make your way across the shop floor, soft light cast from an aether-lantern hanging above. {lb} ```A heavy door leads further into the shop, behind a battered old counter, while a smaller door leads back out into the city.
