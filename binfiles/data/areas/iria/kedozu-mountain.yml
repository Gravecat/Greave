FOOT_OF_THE_MOUNTAIN:
  desc: You stand at the foot of the mountain, verdant grassy plains dotted with trees surrounding you while the pale, rocky cliffs to the north reach high into the sky above. A simple trail leads east-west around the base of the colossal mountain, while another well-traveled path branches southward. A small cave entrance at the base of the mountain leads inward, beckoning into the gloom.
