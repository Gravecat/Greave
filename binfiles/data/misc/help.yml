NEWPLAYER: [ "{M}Greave {w}is a single-player survival RPG heavily inspired by the old telnet MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons). The game world consists of a great many different {C}ROOMS{w} - each room represents an area such as a city street, a room in a castle, or a forest trail. Each room is connected via a number of {C}EXITS {w}to other rooms. You can {C}TRAVEL {w}around the world using cardinal compass directions -- for example, type {C}NORTH {w}to travel north. If you're ever unsure where to go, just {C}LOOK {w}around.",
             "You interact with the game world by typing {C}COMMANDS{w}, usually either a single verb (such as {C}TIME{w}), or a verb and noun, such as {C}ATTACK GOBLIN{w}. For a full list of available commands, just type {C}HELP COMMANDS{w}.",
             "Anything you can pick up, carry, use or wear is called an {C}ITEM{w}. Weapons, food, clothing and treasure are all items, and you will find a large variety of different items in the game world to interact with. Items you pick up go in your {C}INVENTORY{w}.",
             "As well as yourself, there are many other people, creatures and monsters living in this world - they are collectively known as {C}MOBILES{w}. Some are friendly, some will attack you on sight, and some just haven't made their minds up about you yet. You can {C}ATTACK{w} any mobile you wish." ]
