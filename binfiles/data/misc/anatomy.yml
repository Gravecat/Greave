# data/misc/anatomy.yml -- Body part definitions for various creature types.
# Copyright (c) 2020-2021 Raine "Gravecat" Simmons. Licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 or any later version.

# Any number of body parts can be specified here, they should be listed in order of hit % chance, with the highest at the top.
# Hit % is rolled from 1-100, and first checks if the rolled number is equal to or above the highest entry. If not, it checks
# the next entry down in the list and so on, meaning the last entry on the list should alwayas be 1.

# The name of the body part is specified on the left. In braces, we have the hit % chance, and the actual armour piece that
# this body part translates to (as all mobiles have armour slots for body, head, hands and feet, regardless of their real
# anatomy). Multiple body parts can translate to the same armour location.

# The translation point does not necessarily have to make logical sense (e.g. a dog's tail counting as its hands armour).
# The important thing is, for the most part, the body armour should be the part getting hit the most often. Think of body,
# feet, hands and head armour as simply being one major, and three minor armoured pieces.
