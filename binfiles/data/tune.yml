# If you create a file called tune.yml in your Greave userdata folder, it will look for these settings there first.
# That way, you can tweak only the settings you want in your own personal override file, without worrying about
# newer versions of the game overwriting your settings with the latest data files. You only need to include the
# values that have changed, so just copy-paste the lines you want to change, not the entire file.

# USER SETTINGS: Feel free to tweak these, but I recommend doing so #
